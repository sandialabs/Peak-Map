    This is an example of an appendix.

    If we follow~\cite{Sand98-0730} strictly, we would have to have
    a separate bibliography section for each appendix.  The style
    file doesn't provide that, but it can be done using the {\tt
    bibunits} and {\tt chapterbib} packages.

    If there are many subsections in an appendix, it should also
    have its own table of contents. Again, the SAND report class
    file does not provide that functionality.

	\subsection{The Past a Long Time Ago}
	This is where we talk about things so old nobody can verify
	them. We are safe.

	\subsection{The Past More Recently}
	Now we have to be a little bit more careful, since records
	exist from that time, and some people still alive actually
	lived back then.
